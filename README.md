hello I'm HertzFennec, 16-year-old aspiring hobbyist game developer 

I mainly script in GDScript (as Godot is my main engine), although I also have minimal Python experience.

My dream game? A dystopian turn-based RPG, with bullet-hell mechanics like Touhou. 

Some of my other hobbies: Meteorology, Music Production and Nerf blasters.
